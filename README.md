# Mycorrhizae Cost Parameters Project

## Description
This repository, `mycorrhizae_cost_parameters`, is dedicated to hosting the Python scripts used for analyzing and modeling the carbon cost of plant nutrient acquisition influenced by mycorrhizal fungi. This work is part of an effort to enhance the accuracy of Earth System Models (ESMs) by integrating spatially explicit mycorrhizal data. The scripts within facilitate the processing and visualization of data related to carbon and nitrogen acquisition cost parameters (Kc and Kn) for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi.

## Repository Structure

- **plot_akc_params.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for plotting AM carbon acquisition cost parameters.
- **plot_akn_params.ipynb**: Visualization of AM nitrogen acquisition cost parameters.
- **plot_ekc_params.ipynb**: Ectomycorrhizal carbon acquisition cost parameters plotting script.
- **plot_ekn_params.ipynb**: Script for illustrating EcM nitrogen acquisition parameters.
- **plot_pfts.ipynb**: Notebook for visualizing plant functional types (PFTs) related to mycorrhizal associations.
- **plot_change_nbp_totc.ipynb**: Analysis of changes in Net Biome Production (NBP) and Total Carbon (TotC) in response to mycorrhizal associations.
- **plot_change_npp_totc.ipynb**: Script for assessing the impact of mycorrhizal associations on Net Primary Production (NPP) and Total Carbon.

## Data
The notebooks use datasets that provide global insights into the role of mycorrhizae in carbon and nutrient cycling within various ecosystems. (Note: Actual data files are not provided in this repository and must be obtained separately.)

## How to Use
To use these scripts:
1. Ensure you have a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Obtain the necessary datasets as detailed in the Data section.
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks to run the analyses and generate visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas 

## Installation
To set up your environment to run these notebooks, you can follow these steps:
